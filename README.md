If you're quiet for a minute . . . . you might be able to hear it. . .
Open your window, go for a walk, open your ears to the soundscape around you. 
This is local sounds, bringing the local artists and sounds to you. 
Are you listening?
The kid smashing drums in her parents garage.
The old man up the street stroking a guitar lightly on his poarch. 
Your next door neighbor belting a ballet in the shower.

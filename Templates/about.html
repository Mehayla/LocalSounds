    <h2>Hello, my name is Mehayla.</h2>

    <p> Thanks for looking at my project! I coded and designed 
        it all myself! It is perfectly imperfect and a work in 
        progress, just like mylsef.</p>

    <p> This project was built using the spotify API and a data 
        set from ____{nameeee}____. He is data scientist from NY 
        that was doing a maping project with artists. I used his 
        gathered data as a jumping off point.</p>
